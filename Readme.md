## Overview
### Description
TripMap is an ultimate travel companion for busy adventurers and frequent travelers. With TripMap, users can effortlessly consolidate all their flight details in one place. User-friendly interface allows users to input their flight information quickly and intuitively, giving them instant access to their upcoming trips.


### App Evaluation

Mobile:
Travel planner app allows users to carry their itineraries, travel information, and booking details with them wherever they go. This portability is a key advantage of mobile travel planning.

Value to customers:
Imagine having all trip details and travel arrangements neatly organized in one place, accessible at fingertips. My travel planner app offers the ultimate convenience, eliminating the need to juggle multiple websites, emails, and booking platforms. With my app, customers entire travel experience is streamlined, from flight bookings and accommodation reservations to itinerary planning and local recommendations. Users can effortlessly access and manage all their travel information in one cohesive platform, making it easier than ever to stay on top of their journey.

Travel:
My travel planner app is designed for the modern globetrotter, catering to individuals and professionals who lead busy lives and find it challenging to keep track of their travel itineraries. My ideal users are frequent travelers, whether for business or leisure, who often juggle multiple trips, flight bookings, hotel reservations, and activity plans. They seek a seamless solution to simplify their travel experiences and eliminate the stress of organizing details scattered across various platforms.

Habit:
My travel planner app doesn't just make users current trip more convenient; it establishes a lasting relationship with them as a traveler. Once they experience the ease of organizing and managing their travel plans with my app, they will naturally gravitate towards it for all their future trips. The simplicity and efficiency it offers become an integral part of their travel routine.

Scope:
I think building an entire travel planner app in a 2 week span is challenging. I will be focusing on streamlining just the flight details, simplifying booking, and making tracking the air travel for now. In future my goal is to create a full-featured travel planner that covers all aspects of trips, from accommodations to activities, but I want to start by perfecting one component at a time.
